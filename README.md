  * Auto migration from scratch to up to date
  * Step by step forward migration
  * Step by step backward migration
  * Migrate to a specific version forward or backward
  * Subfolder deep search for migration scripts
  * All or nothing (Transactional migration)
  * Can use on any system that can connect to target PostgreSQL database


## Installation

Install this globally and you'll have access to the pg-migrator command anywhere on your system.

    $ npm install -g pg-migrator

## Quick Start

The quickest way to migrate the target database with pg-migrator is type "pg-migrator" and a valid connection string as shown below.

    $ pg-migrator postgres://username:password@localhost/testdb

This command will migrate the "testdb" database to the latest version according to migration scripts.

You can also chose the target version with a second parameter as shown below.

    $ pg-migrator postgres://username:password@localhost/testdb 15

This command will migrate the "testdb" database to version 15 (forward or backward according to current database version). Other avaliable version options are shown below.

  * +1 : One step forward migration
  * -1 : One step backward migration

Samples for one step migration;

    $ pg-migrator postgres://username:password@localhost/testdb +1
    $ pg-migrator postgres://username:password@localhost/testdb -1

## Migration Scripts

pg-migrator uses migration scripts in current execution folder or subfolders. All migration scripts files must have an extension with ".sql" (case insensitive) and "x-y.sql" format that x and y must be valid numbers. Both numbers also must be sequential. All other files will be ignored.

Migration scripts can contain any valid sql statements like create/alter table and also insert/update etc.

You can categorize your scripts with folders as you wish. pg-migrator search all subfolders and put them in order according to x-y numbers in file names of folder structure.

Sample migration script file names;
```
25-26.sql : Migration script from version 25 to version 26 for forward migration
26-25.sql : Migration script from version 26 to version 25 for backward migration
```
Let's say, our database is in version 25 at the moment. If you request one step forward migration, pg-migrator searches folders for a file with "25-26.sql" name and if can't found, displays an error message.

Likewise, if you request one step backward migration, at this time, pg-migrator searches folders for a file with "25-24.sql" name and if can't found, displays an error message.

So, your migration scripts must be started from "1-2.sql" and go on like "2-3.sql", "3-4.sql" etc.

For backward migration, your must also have files like "2-1.sql" and go on like "3-2.sql", "4-3.sql" etc.

You can find sample migration script file in the "examples" folder

## Step by Step Example

Let's go step by step from the scratch.

As a first step, we need a database. Let's create a new database with "testdb" name. At the moment, there is no table this db.

IMAGE

As a beginning to development, we need two tables, "user" and "user_login_history". Let's write some script to create them but don't execute it yet. We'll use pg-migratior for execution.

```
/*** Add user and user_login_history tables and insert some data ***/

CREATE TABLE "user"
(
   id serial,
   username character(20)  NOT NULL,
   name_surname character(50) NOT NULL,
   CONSTRAINT pk_user PRIMARY KEY (id),
   CONSTRAINT uk_user UNIQUE (username)
)
WITH (
  OIDS = FALSE
);

CREATE TABLE "user_login_history"
(
   id serial,
   user_id integer NOT NULL,
   login_date date NOT NULL,
   CONSTRAINT pk_user_login_history PRIMARY KEY (id),
   CONSTRAINT fk_user_login_history FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES "user" (id) ON UPDATE NO ACTION ON DELETE NO ACTION
)
WITH (
  OIDS = FALSE
);

INSERT INTO "user"(username, name_surname)
    VALUES ('user1', 'User 1');

INSERT INTO "user"(username, name_surname)
    VALUES ('user2', 'User 2');

INSERT INTO user_login_history(user_id, login_date)
    VALUES (1, '2014-01-01');

INSERT INTO user_login_history(user_id, login_date)
    VALUES (1, '2014-01-02');

INSERT INTO user_login_history(user_id, login_date)
    VALUES (2, '2014-02-01');

INSERT INTO user_login_history(user_id, login_date)
    VALUES (2, '2014-02-02');

```

With this script, we're creating two tables and insert some data to them. Let's save this script with "1-2.sql" name. When this script executed, our database will be migrated from version 1 to version 2 (Forward migration).

Ok, that was the first one and we need an opposite script in case of roll back this operation. This script can be written like below.

```
/*** Remove user and user_login_history tables ***/

DROP TABLE "user_login_history";

DROP TABLE "user";

```

That was quite easy, just deleted all tables. We'll save this script with "2-1.sql". When this script executed, our database will be migrated from version 2 to version 1 (Backward migration).

Ok, let's continue to development. At this time, we need to add a new column to user table with "is_admin" name so write the script below and save it with "2-3.sql".

```
/*** Add is_admin column to user table ***/

ALTER TABLE "user"
  ADD COLUMN is_admin bit;

UPDATE "user" SET is_admin = '0'

ALTER TABLE "user"
   ALTER COLUMN is_admin SET NOT NULL;
```

Why don't we just add a new column with NOT NULL keyword directly? Because during two versions, some data may be inserted into the table so we can't create a new column with NOT NULL property. So, we've created a new column with NULL property, update all posible data to a default value then alter the column with NOT NULL property (Of course, you can define a default value for the new column but this property will stay on the column. This way is much more reasonable for production).

We need a roll back script again. Let's save the script below with "3-2.sql" name. This will just drop the new inserted column.

```
/*** Remove is_admin column from user table ***/

ALTER TABLE "user" DROP COLUMN is_admin;

```

Continue to development. We need a new table with "company" name and connect it with existing "user" table. So write the script below and save it with "3-4.sql".

```
/*** Add company table, insert some data and connect with user table ***/

CREATE TABLE "company"
(
   id serial,
   company_name character(20) NOT NULL,
   CONSTRAINT pk_company PRIMARY KEY (id),
   CONSTRAINT uk_company UNIQUE (company_name)
)
WITH (
  OIDS = FALSE
);

INSERT INTO "company"(company_name)
    VALUES ('Company 1');

ALTER TABLE "user"
  ADD COLUMN company_id integer;

UPDATE "user" SET company_id = 1

ALTER TABLE "user"
   ALTER COLUMN company_id SET NOT NULL;

ALTER TABLE "user"
  ADD CONSTRAINT fk_user FOREIGN KEY (company_id) REFERENCES company (id) ON UPDATE NO ACTION ON DELETE NO ACTION;

```
Not confused yet? Ok, I'll do my best :)

We have just created a new table, insert some data in it. Add a new column to the "user" table and connect it to the new table with a foreign key.

Let's write a roll back script and save as "4-3.sql". We have just delete foreign key, new added column and the table.

```
/*** Remove company table and disconnect user table ***/

ALTER TABLE "user" DROP CONSTRAINT fk_user;

ALTER TABLE "user" DROP COLUMN company_id;

DROP TABLE "company";

```
Before start the show, we will create a last script. This time for performance tuning. Let's create a few index with the following script (4-5.sql).

```
/*** Create indexes for user and company tables ***/

CREATE INDEX ix_user
   ON "user" (username ASC NULLS LAST);

CREATE INDEX ix_company
   ON "company" (company_name ASC NULLS LAST);

```

And the roll back script (4-4.sql).

```
/*** Remove indexes from user and company tables ***/

DROP INDEX ix_user;

DROP INDEX ix_company;

```

That all. We can start to use pg-migrator now. Because pg-migrator can seek and execute migration script in any subfolders, I will categorize scripts like below.

## Common Pitfalls
* pg-migrator must be executed in the root of migration scripts folder. It will search all directory content and all subfolders content recursively.
* Migration script files must be in "x-y.sql" format that x and y must be valid numbers. Both numbers also must be sequential. All other files will be ignored.
* All migrations scripts are executed in same transaction scope and totally roll back in case of fail so you shouldn't put any transaction statements in your scripts.

## Running Tests

To run the test suite, first invoke the following command within the repo, installing the development dependencies:

    $ npm install
